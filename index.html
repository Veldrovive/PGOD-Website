                <ul id="rulesList">
                    <li class="rulesItem">1) Be respectful of ALL Guardians under ALL circumstances. When you wear the P G O D tag, you represent the entire community, just as if you were on sports team. The goal is to welcome more players into our group, and that will not happen if people are disrespectful to others. No one wants to play with the person who is constantly putting people down in the raid group. Don't be THAT guy.</li>
                    <li class="rulesItem">2) You must have a mic at all times, especially if you are planning on joining a raid/Trials of Osiris event. Communication is important in Destiny and when you are unable to talk in-game, it creates a lot of issues. </li>
                    <li class="rulesItem">3) You must have the P G O D tag on your Destiny character. This can be done by setting the group as your Xbox/PS clan on the group page here on Bungie.net</li>
                    <li class="rulesItem">4) You must be honest. Don't lie about your experience under any circumstances. There is no reason to lie about whether you have done the raid or say you have a 2.8 K/D when you really don't. Our goal as a community is to help one another, so if you are honest, other members of the group will be happy to help you!</li>
                    <li class="rulesItem">5) HAVE FUN! This is a game, and a great one at that. Enjoy it as much as you can.</li>
